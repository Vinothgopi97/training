<h2>Java 15 - Important Concepts</h2>

<h3>1. Text Blocks (Standard)</h3>
<p>
  Text blocks became a standard feature, allowing multi-line string literals.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
String json = """
    {
      "name": "Java",
      "version": 15
    }
    """;
System.out.println(json);
</code>
</pre>

<h3>2. Sealed Classes (Preview)</h3>
<p>
  Sealed classes restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {}
final class Circle extends Shape {}
final class Square extends Shape {}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>3. Hidden Classes</h3>
<p>
  Hidden classes are classes that cannot be used directly by the bytecode of other classes and are intended for use by frameworks that generate classes at runtime.
</p>
