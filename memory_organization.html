    <h2>Memory Organization in Computer Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        Memory organization refers to the way data is stored, accessed, and managed in a computer system. It is a fundamental aspect of computer architecture, affecting performance, efficiency, and reliability.
    </p>
    <h3>Main Types of Memory</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Memory (Main Memory):</strong> Fast, directly accessible by the CPU. Includes RAM (Random Access Memory) and cache.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Memory:</strong> Slower, used for long-term storage. Includes hard drives, SSDs, CDs, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Cache Memory:</strong> Very fast, small-sized memory located close to the CPU to speed up access to frequently used data.</li>
        <li><strong>Registers:</strong> Smallest and fastest memory, located inside the CPU, used to hold instructions and data currently being processed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Memory Hierarchy Diagram</h3>
    <div>
        <img src="assets/memory_hierarchy.png" alt="Memory Hierarchy" style="width:60%; height:auto;">
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Registers</strong> &rarr; <strong>Cache</strong> &rarr; <strong>Main Memory (RAM)</strong> &rarr; <strong>Secondary Storage</strong></li>
        <li>Speed decreases and capacity increases as you move down the hierarchy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Primary Memory (RAM)</h3>
    <p>
        RAM is volatile memory, meaning its contents are lost when power is turned off. It is used to store data and instructions that are currently in use.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
+-------------------+
|      CPU          |
+-------------------+
         |
+-------------------+
|    Cache Memory   |
+-------------------+
         |
+-------------------+
|       RAM         |
+-------------------+
         |
+-------------------+
| Secondary Storage |
+-------------------+
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Cache Memory</h3>
    <p>
        Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory between the CPU and RAM. It stores frequently accessed data and instructions to reduce access time.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>L1 Cache:</strong> Smallest and fastest, located inside the CPU core.</li>
        <li><strong>L2 Cache:</strong> Larger than L1, may be inside or outside the CPU core.</li>
        <li><strong>L3 Cache:</strong> Shared among CPU cores, larger and slower than L1/L2.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary Memory</h3>
    <p>
        Secondary memory is non-volatile and used for permanent data storage. Examples include HDDs, SSDs, USB drives, and optical disks.
    </p>

    <h3>Example: How Data Flows</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CPU requests data.</li>
        <li>If data is in a register, it is accessed instantly.</li>
        <li>If not, CPU checks cache memory (L1, L2, L3).</li>
        <li>If not in cache, data is fetched from RAM.</li>
        <li>If not in RAM, data is loaded from secondary storage into RAM, then to cache, then to CPU.</li>
    </ol>
