    <h2>What is a Programming Language?</h2>
    <p>
        A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms and control the behavior of machines.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples: Python, C, Java, JavaScript, etc.</li>
        <li>Used to communicate instructions to a computer.</li>
        <li>Allows developers to express logic, operations, and behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Low-Level Languages</h3>
    <p>
        Low-level languages are closer to machine hardware and provide little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture. They are fast and memory-efficient but harder to write and understand.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Machine Language:</strong> The native binary code (0s and 1s) understood directly by the CPU.</li>
        <li><strong>Assembly Language:</strong> Uses mnemonic codes and labels instead of binary, but still closely maps to machine instructions.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>; Example: x86 Assembly to add two numbers
MOV AX, 5
ADD AX, 3
; AX now contains 8
</code></pre>



    <h3>High-Level Languages</h3>
    <p>
        High-level languages are more abstract, easier to read, write, and maintain. They are portable across platforms and allow developers to focus on logic rather than hardware details.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examples: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code># Example: Python code to add two numbers
a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 8
</code></pre>

    <h3>Assembly Language</h3>
    <p>
        Assembly language is a type of low-level language that uses symbolic names (mnemonics) for instructions and memory locations. It requires an assembler to convert it to machine code.
    </p>
    <pre><code>; Example: ARM Assembly
MOV R0, #5
MOV R1, #3
ADD R2, R0, R1
; R2 now contains 8
</code></pre>

    <h3>Bytecode</h3>
    <p>
        Bytecode is an intermediate code between source code and machine code. It is generated by compiling high-level code and is executed by a virtual machine (e.g., Java Virtual Machine).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Platform-independent: Write once, run anywhere (with the right VM).</li>
        <li>Examples: Java bytecode, Python bytecode (.pyc files)</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>// Example: Java source code
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

/*
After compilation, the Java compiler generates bytecode (HelloWorld.class):
Compiled bytecode (simplified):
0: getstatic     #2 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
3: ldc           #1 // String Hello, World!
6: invokevirtual #3 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
9: return
*/
</code></pre>
<h3>Machine Code</h3>
<p>
    Machine code is the lowest-level programming language, consisting entirely of binary digits (0s and 1s) that are directly executed by a computer's CPU. Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as loading data from memory or performing arithmetic.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Directly understood by the hardware (CPU).</li>
    <li>Not human-readable and highly hardware-specific.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
# Example: Machine code (x86, hexadecimal representation)
B8 05 00        ; MOV AX, 5
05 03 00        ; ADD AX, 3
# After execution, AX register contains 8
</code></pre>
