    <h1>What is an Algorithm?</h1>
    <p>
        An <strong>algorithm</strong> is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a task. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and programming, as they provide a clear method for computers to process data and make decisions.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic Concepts of Algorithms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input:</strong> The data or values that are provided to the algorithm to process.</li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> The result or solution produced by the algorithm after processing the input.</li>
        <li><strong>Definiteness:</strong> Each step of the algorithm must be clear and unambiguous.</li>
        <li><strong>Finiteness:</strong> The algorithm must complete after a finite number of steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Each operation must be basic enough to be performed exactly and in a finite amount of time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why are Algorithms Important?</h2>
    <p>
        Algorithms help us solve problems efficiently and consistently. They are used in everyday applications such as searching for information, sorting data, encrypting messages, and much more.
    </p>
    <h2>Example: Algorithm to Add Two Numbers</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <ol>
            <li>Start</li>
            <li>Input the first number (<code>a</code>)</li>
            <li>Input the second number (<code>b</code>)</li>
            <li>Add the two numbers: <code>sum = a + b</code></li>
            <li>Output the result (<code>sum</code>)</li>
            <li>End</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>Common Types of Algorithms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)</li>
        <li>Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort)</li>
        <li>Mathematical algorithms (e.g., finding the greatest common divisor)</li>
        <li>Graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path, traversals)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As you learn programming, you'll encounter many algorithms. Understanding their logic and how to implement them is a key skill for every developer!
