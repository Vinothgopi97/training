    <h1>Thread Starvation in Java</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Thread starvation</b> occurs when a thread is unable to gain regular access to the resources it needs for execution, because other threads are constantly acquiring those resources.
    </p>
    <h2>Causes of Starvation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>High-priority threads monopolizing CPU time.</li>
        <li>Improper use of synchronization or locks.</li>
        <li>Threads waiting indefinitely for resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If a low-priority thread is waiting for a lock held by a high-priority thread that never releases it, the low-priority thread may starve.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Avoid Starvation?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use fair locking mechanisms (e.g., <code>ReentrantLock</code> with fairness).</li>
        <li>Avoid holding locks for long periods.</li>
        <li>Design thread scheduling carefully.</li>
    </ul>
