    <h1>What is a Data Structure?</h1>
    <p>
        A <strong>data structure</strong> is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be used efficiently. 
        Just like you use folders to organize files on your computer, programmers use data structures to organize data in programs.
    </p>
    <h2>Why are Data Structures Important?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>They help store data in a way that makes it easy to access and modify.</li>
        <li>They make programs faster and more efficient.</li>
        <li>They help solve different types of problems, like searching, sorting, and managing large amounts of data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Common Types of Data Structures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Array:</strong> Stores items in a fixed-size list. Example: a list of numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Linked List:</strong> Each item points to the next one, like a chain.</li>
        <li><strong>Stack:</strong> Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure. Think of a stack of plates.</li>
        <li><strong>Queue:</strong> First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure. Like a line at a ticket counter.</li>
        <li><strong>Tree:</strong> Data is organized in a hierarchy, like a family tree.</li>
        <li><strong>Hash Table:</strong> Stores key-value pairs for fast lookup.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        Imagine you want to keep track of your friends' phone numbers. You could use an <b>array</b> to store the list of names and numbers, or a <b>hash table</b> to quickly find a number by name.
    </div>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Data structures are fundamental concepts in programming. Learning them helps you write better, faster, and more organized code!
