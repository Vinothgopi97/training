<h2>Java 12 - Important Concepts</h2>

<h3>1. Switch Expressions (Preview)</h3>
<p>
  Switch expressions allow switch to be used as an expression, returning a value. This feature was introduced as a preview.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
int day = 3;
String result = switch (day) {
    case 1, 2, 3 -> "Start of week";
    case 4, 5 -> "Midweek";
    default -> "Weekend";
};
System.out.println(result);
</code>
</pre>

<h3>2. JVM Constants API</h3>
<p>
  Introduces a new API to model nominal descriptions of key class-file and run-time artifacts, such as constants that are loadable from the constant pool.
</p>

<h3>3. Shenandoah and ZGC Improvements</h3>
<p>
  Enhancements to low-pause-time garbage collectors (Shenandoah and ZGC) for better performance and scalability.
